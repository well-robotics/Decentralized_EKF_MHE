## Decentral_legged_est package
This package implements the Decentralized MHE estimation for legged robots.
## Package structure
1. **EstSub.hpp**: Superclass interface for hardware deployment, sub to orientation EKF and VO_ros2 interface by default.
2. **DecentralEst.hpp**: Setup the MHE problem as constrained optimization problem.
3. **MheSrb.hpp**: Configurate the MHE as Quadratic Program, solved using OSQP sparse optimization.
